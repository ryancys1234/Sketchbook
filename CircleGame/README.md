## The Circle Game

The game is comprised of an arc rotating with respect to the position of the mouse. The main object is a ball that has to bounce on the rotating arc. The ball has to stay on the arc; falling off results in lives eliminated.

How long the space bar is pressed is how high the ball will jump; there is a limit to the height, however, by the borders of the 800 x 800 game.

The opening screen will be comprised of rotating arcs in themselves, and when the game is initiated the player will be presented with increasing difficult levels made of different arcs in different locations and settings, and with new and ever-changing obstacles.
